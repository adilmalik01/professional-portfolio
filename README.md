### ✨ Seo

1. The project automatically generates sitemap.xml and robots.txt files within the public folder by leveraging the project's file structure. This process is initiated through the scripts located at src/scripts/generateSitemap.mjs, executed either after the project is built or by running the command `pnpm sitemap`.
2. It's important to note that [dynamic routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes), identified by file or folder names in square brackets (e.g., [segmentName], [id], or [slug]), are excluded from the sitemap.xml.
3. Update google site verification code with your own inside `/src/data/siteMetaData.mjs`. Can be created for free using your google email id at <https://search.google.com/search-console/welcome>
